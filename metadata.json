    "Description": "MoLeR is a graph-based generative model that combines fragment-based and atom-by-atom generation of new molecules with scaffold-constrained optimization. It does not depend on generation history and therefore MoLeR is able to complete arbitrary scaffolds. The model has been trained on the GuacaMol dataset.",
